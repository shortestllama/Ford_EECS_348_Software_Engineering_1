			I am 20 years old and a full time student at the University of Kansas. I grew up in Oswego, IL and moved to Kansas when I started at KU. Some extracurricular activities I enjoy take place in the Information Security and KU Men's Volleyball clubs. I've only been in the Information Security club for a year, but I've gained several unique experiences through it. I've been a part of the volleyball club for 2 years now. Sports have always been an important activity in my life and volleyball has allowed me to continue that with others who enjoy the sport. This year, nationals are taking place in Kansas City and I am leading the team as the president for the final tournament of the year. I am very excited to compete this year!
